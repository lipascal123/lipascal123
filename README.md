### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm conducting my master thesis at the Robotics Systems Lab at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
My experience lies in sensor fusion and perception for mobile robots.

Since 3 years I've been working on the autonomous agricultural robot called Rosie.
Check out the pohots and videos below!

  - ***Sensor fusion***
    - Graph based sensor fusion for agiruclutral robots fusing VIO, (RTK) GPS, Wheel Odometry.
      -  add picture of robot and graph
      -  For more information feel free to get in touch with me!
  - ***Compute Vision & Machine Learning***
    - Master thesis
      - Camera based passage detection in different and changing environments leveraging self supervised features.
      - add gif from gian
    - Visual odometry pipeline 
      - Link to repository  


In my free time I enjoy adding fancy and cool features to our Robot Rosie 
for example this path planner and with an integrated collision checker:
