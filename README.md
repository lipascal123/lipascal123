My passion is all about autonomous robots. 


Check out some videos about my work on autonomous agricultural robots!


My expertise lies in sensor fusion for localization and perception for local path planning.


In general like to add the touch of intelligent behaviour to robots.

In my free time I enjoy adding fancy and cool features to our Robot Rosie 
for example this path planner and with an integrated collision checker:
- add link to repository


  - ***Sensor fusion***
    - Graph based sensor fusion for agiruclutral robots fusing VIO, (RTK) GPS, Wheel Odometry.
      -  add picture of robot and graph
      -  For more information feel free to get in touch with me!
  - ***Compute Vision & Machine Learning***
    - Master thesis
      - Camera based passage detection in different and changing environments leveraging self supervised features.
      - add gif from gian
    - Visual odometry pipeline 
      - Link to repository
