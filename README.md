## Agricultural robotics

My passion is all about autonomous robots. The last 2 years I've been developing the autonomy software stack for the robot depicted on the left. 
[See our robot in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVbg3PDAPEI&t=23s)!

## My expertise 

My expertise lies in sensor fusion for localization and perception for local path planning.

  - ***Sensor fusion***
    - Graph based sensor fusion for agiruclutral robots fusing VIO, (RTK) GPS, Wheel Odometry.
      -  [Semester project report](https://github.com/lipascal123/lipascal123/files/9961735/Graph_Based_State_Estimation_for_Agricutlural_Robots.pdf)

  - ***Perception***
    - Visual odometry pipeline 
      - Basic implementation of a VO pipeline.
      - [Link to repo](https://github.com/lipascal123/vamr-mini-project) 
    - Passage following in changing and different environments.
      - Current project im working on as part of my master thesis at the Robotics Systems Lab at ETH ZÃ¼rich 
    
 
 The pinned repositories show some work I conducted in my free time or as part of lectures at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
